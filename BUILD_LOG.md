# BUILD LOG — Themis (`themis`)

## 2026-09-28 — P0 scaffold (Zeus NEW PRODUCT)

- Attempted: house front-end stack, working decision matrix, CI + Pages deploy, crew kit, brain.
- Passed: lint, typecheck, 15 tests (close-call boundary test mutation-verified RED), `vite build`.
- Blocked: nothing.
- Next: operator answers BRAIN Q1 → spec F1 (AI analyst) → P1 when persistence is needed.

## 2026-09-28 (later) — rename to Themis + brand

- Passed: lint, typecheck, 16 tests, build; page rendered and inspected at 1440px and at a true
  390px width (iframe). A phone overflow was found that way and fixed.
- BLOCKED: push/deploy. The gh token lacks the `workflow` scope (BRAIN §4 B1); waiting on the operator.

## 2026-09-28 (deploy)

- LIVE: https://intotheveil.github.io/themis/ (run 36448167598: verify + deploy success; assets 200).

## 2026-09-28 — P1.1 ADR-0002 + constitution for a shared database

- Did: ADR-0002 in DECISIONS.md; CLAUDE.project.md §2/§8/§11 (Supabase schema `themis`, `db:gate`,
  `db:gate:prove-red`, `db:apply`, e2e in P2, never `supabase db push`/`link`); BRAIN §2/§3/§6/§7.
  CLAUDE.md recomposed via `kit.mjs apply`, `kit.mjs check` canonical. No migration, no live DB touched.
- Next: P1.2.

## 2026-09-28 — P1.2 `db:gate` harness and bootstrap migration

- Did: `npm run db:gate` (`scripts/db-gate.mjs`, PGlite 0.5.8 devDep) on the argus-news pattern —
  in-memory, `DB_GATE_MIGRATIONS` override, exit 1 on any FAIL, "no migrations found" is a FAIL.
  `scripts/db-gate/shim.mjs` dresses the db as the SHARED project: roles anon/authenticated/
  service_role (bypassrls), `auth.uid()`/`auth.users`, Supabase default privileges in `public`,
  a Hephaestus-shaped `public` (organizations, profiles, memberships, workspaces, tasks; RLS on)
  and `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` with 25 rows. Nothing is pre-granted on `themis`.
  Migration added: `supabase/migrations/20260928200000_themis_schema.sql` (schema, `schema_migrations`
  with RLS/no policies/no API grants, `touch_updated_at()` with `search_path=''`, USAGE to the
  three API roles, default-privileges revoke of EXECUTE from PUBLIC in `themis`).
- Passed: `npm run db:gate` → 17 PASS, `GATE PASSED`, exit 0. Proven RED (exit 1) on: empty dir,
  missing dir, the USAGE grant removed (3 FAIL lines), a non-idempotent migration, a SQL error.
  lint, typecheck, 17 tests green. No live project touched.
- Next: P1.3 (static migration guard).
